## nix flake

This repo includes a Nix flake for a ready-to-use development shell inspired by my soil repo.

- Enter the dev shell: `nix develop`
- Run Tauri dev: `nix run .#dev`
- Build release bundles: `nix run .#build`

Inside the shell, youâ€™ll have Rust (with rustfmt and clippy) and Bun available. Common tasks:

- bun install
- bun run dev
- bun run tauri dev
- bun run tauri build

If you use direnv, `.envrc` is provided; allow it with `direnv allow`.

## ci/cd

- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on pushes and PRs to main:
	- Typechecks the frontend via TypeScript
	- Runs rustfmt, clippy, and tests for the `src-tauri` crate

- Releases (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) are triggered by tags matching `v*.*.*` and use the official Tauri action to build and upload native bundles for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### release prerequisites

- No special secrets are required beyond the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Ensure the repo has a tag like `v0.1.0` to trigger a release build
